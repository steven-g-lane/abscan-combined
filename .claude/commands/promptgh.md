Read issue $ARGUMENTS from the Github repo, then craft a development prompt to the coding agent. The prompt should instruct the agent to read issue $ARGUMENTS, and create a plan for implementing or fixing it. Feel free to create a verbose prompt with an overview, implementation considerations, etc.

Then copy the development prompt to the system clipboard using pbcopy and let the user know the issue is copied and ready
